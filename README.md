#Designed a C++ program using BFS algorithm to evaluate system utilization, hyperperiod and optimize frame size.
#Applied Iterative Network Flow algorithm to C++ program for arranging tasks in different frame.
#Classified tasks to four groups due to the period of task, developed a static schedule for tasks.
